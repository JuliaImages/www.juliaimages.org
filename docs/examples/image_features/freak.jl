# `FREAK` (Fast Retina Keypoint) has a defined sampling pattern like [BRISK](brisk.md).
# It uses a retinal sampling grid with more density of points near the centre
# with the density decreasing exponentially with distance from the centre.

# FREAK’s measure of orientation is similar to [BRISK](brisk.md) but instead of using 
# long pairs, it uses a set of predefined 45 symmetric sampling pairs. The set of 
# sampling pairs is determined using a method similar to [ORB](orb.md), by finding 
# sampling pairs over keypoints in standard datasets and then extracting the most 
# discriminative pairs. The orientation weights over these pairs are summed and the 
# sampling window is rotated by this orientation to some canonical orientation to 
# achieve rotation invariance.

# The descriptor is built using intensity comparisons of a predetermined set of 512 
# sampling pairs. This set is also obtained using a method similar to the one described 
# above. For each pair if the first point has greater intensity than the second, 
# then 1 is written else 0 is written to the corresponding bit of the descriptor.

# ## Example

# Let us take a look at a simple example where the FREAK descriptor is used to 
# match two images where one has been translated by `(50, 40)` pixels and then 
# rotated by an angle of 75 degrees. We will use the `lighthouse` image from 
# the [TestImages](https://github.com/timholy/TestImages.jl) package for this example.

# First, let us create the two images we will match using FREAK.

using ImageFeatures, TestImages, Images, ImageDraw, CoordinateTransformations, Rotations

img = testimage("peppers_color")

# Original

img1 = Gray.(img)
rot = recenter(RotMatrix(5pi/6), [size(img1)...] .÷ 2)  # a rotation around the center
tform = rot ∘ Translation(-50, -40)
img2 = warp(img1, tform, axes(img1))

# To calculate the descriptors, we first need to get the keypoints. For this 
# tutorial, we will use the FAST corners to generate keypoints (see [`fastcorners`](@ref)).

keypoints_1 = Keypoints(fastcorners(img1, 12, 0.35))
keypoints_2 = Keypoints(fastcorners(img2, 12, 0.35))


# To create the FREAK descriptor, we first need to define the parameters 
# by calling the [`FREAK`](@ref) constructor.

freak_params = FREAK()

# Now pass the image with the keypoints and the parameters to the [`create_descriptor`](@ref) function.

desc_1, ret_keypoints_1 = create_descriptor(img1, keypoints_1, freak_params)
desc_2, ret_keypoints_2 = create_descriptor(img2, keypoints_2, freak_params)

# The obtained descriptors can be used to find the matches between the two 
# images using the [`match_keypoints`](@ref) function.

matches = match_keypoints(ret_keypoints_1, ret_keypoints_2, desc_1, desc_2, 0.1)

# We can use the [ImageDraw.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageDraw.jl)
# package to view the results.

grid = hcat(img1, img2)
offset = CartesianIndex(0, size(img1, 2))
map(m -> draw!(grid, LineSegment(m[1], m[2] + offset)), matches)
